The code runs such that it receives each input command and processes it and gives a corresponding output. 
But before the usage the storage for the data is supposed to be initialised which is a linked list table. 
The command prompt will repeatedly prompt to  provide input since the function part is contained within a do while loop. 
The commands perform the following functions:
1)it can collect url with storeurl command
2)while the get command reveals the shortkey for each url which are unique since its their coreresponding hashcode
  and it also simultaneously increments the variable count to let know the no. of accessing.
3)count gives the number of times that the url was called
4)list outputs all the data within the linked list table in the form of json with the help of gson package
5)exit command will terminate the program
